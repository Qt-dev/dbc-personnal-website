        <h2>Hi! Bonjour! 안녕~</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Quentin, from France. I'm a web developper, enrolled in DevBootcamp in San Francisco. More importantly, I am a passionated guy who likes to talk...<br>
          Here is the page where I tell you more about me

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div class="grid_12">
        <p>
          I am a 27 years old engaged french guy who lived in Korea. Thanks to that huge travel, I learnt how to compress the description in a short sentence, but those who know me may tell you : That is not natural.
        </p>
        <p>
          I talk a lot, I like to share whatever knowledge I have with whoever can manage it. That is why I taught french to foreigners in Paris, I became a tutor in my university, I taught a bit of french culture and language in kindergartens in Korea, made a podcast about Korean culture and news (and no, no gangnam style, sorry, that came later), etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionated at everything I do, but then I also try to do everything I can, whenever I can, one at a time. So, following that thought : 
          I like video games, movies, TV shows (I can't wait for Saul's spinoff...), good books, music, biking, photo, drinking, ... quite anything and everything to be honest.
          Oh and I have a beard that cries the loss of my friend <a href="http://matthewknudsen.com/">Matthew's</a>.

          There are actually many quirky things, and the more time you'll spend with me, the more you'll know about them. Even I discover some every day. But today, I chose to tell you about the fact that I can cook Crepes with... pretty much anything as long as you have some ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was in Korea, I used to introduce french culture to kindergartens all around the country. I had a 6 weeks program with different
          tasks, materials, every week. One week was "cooking week" and so I was making crepes... But let me tell you that when when you have to cook crepes for a whole school, the ingredients you have are a bottle of milk, 12 eggs, a ton of wheat flour, and the tools are a wooden spoon and a "plancha"... You have to become very creative very fast. So that's one thing about me, I became more and more able to cook crepes with what I had here and there. Check the cool pictures (That was in an "Easy" place. I had every tool I wanted there!)
